  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>Lester Bangs was the best damn rock critic that ever lived. At first glance, his reviews read like the drug fueled stream of consciousness ramblings of a pop culture obsessive. Once you finish one of his marathon essays, you realize that he was channeling so much more than that. He was writing about the struggle of life, of love, and of caring too much about something as simple as rock and roll.</p> 
  <p>Lester Bangs got his start as a rock critic in 1969 freelancing for <em>Rolling Stone</em>. His first published piece was a negative review of MC5's classic <em>Kick Out the Jams</em>. He was one of the first critics to latch onto the punk rock movement of the mid '70s. His writings bridged the conceptual gap between '60s garage bands and "proto-punk" bands like Iggy and the Stooges and Patti Smith.</p>
  <p>Bangs died on April 30, 1982 of an accidental overdose of dextropropoxyphene, diazepam, and NyQuil. He was 33.</p>

    Well basically I just started out to lead [an interview] with the most insulting question I could think of. Because it seemed to me that the whole thing of interviewing as far as rock stars and that was just such a suck-up. It was groveling obeisance to people who weren't that special, really. It's just a guy, just another person, so what?
