    Danese Cooper is best known as a leading advocate for the Open Source Software movement. She is also a great example that a thirst for knowledge and a persistent work ethic can be more important than formal training.
  </div>
  <h2 class="h3">Computer Science was her true calling, but not her first calling</h2>
  <p>Despite becoming a major force in the programming world, Danese received her B.A. in French Literature, not a B.S. in Computer Science.</p>
  <blockquote>
    How I became the person I am had everything to do with a desire to make money and the luck to be in the right place at the right time, and a lot of hard work â€“ but I am living proof that it can be done.

      <strong>Open source is already a masterpiece</strong>, it doesn't need editing. But, we do need more diversity and could be nicer to each other.

    <blockquote>
      <strong>It takes a lot of energy to maintain an open source project.</strong> Most participants will try to harmonize within the community rather than forking and working against whatever momentum the primary project has. There's a major cultural taboo against wasting energy like that.

      Open source allows people with a confluence of interesting ideas and an intellectual courage to really synthesize amazing newness. It's an accelerator of the synthesis of amazing ideas and for that I think it will end up being the most important change in the way that we do technology that has happened in my career lifetime.
