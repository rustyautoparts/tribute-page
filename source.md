##The secret sauce of Open Source is Transparency.
It...

- teaches formerly proprietary engineering groups to trust the customer
- generally uplevels coding quality as the potential for public embarrassment increases with increased scrutiny (the famous "massive peer review")
- often enhances job satisfaction since well-written or cleverly implemented code is publicly praised and hard work recognized

The choice whether to trust organizations saying "We know better than you" or those saying "Here's how we work. We have nothing to hide" is easy.

It takes a lot of energy to maintain an open source project. Most participants will try to harmonize within the community rather than forking and working against whatever momentum the primary project has. There's a major cultural taboo against wasting energy like that.

Open source allows people with a confluence of interesting ideas and an intellectual courage to really synthesize amazing newness. It's an accelerator of the synthesis of amazing ideas and for that I think it will end up being the most important change in the way that we do technology that has happened in my career lifetime.
